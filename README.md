## Current Situation

Covid tried to rescue the pandemic that occurred almost everyday at the
bus terminal of some of the Pretoria Campuses. Usually, there is one bus
from a certain campus to another campus for a given period of time.
At times students are writing and students will be waiting for longer period
or end up fighting to get space on the available bus.
