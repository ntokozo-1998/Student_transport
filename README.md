## Current Situation

Covid tried to rescue the pandemic that occurred almost everyday at the
bus terminal of some of the Pretoria Campuses. Usually, there is one bus
from a certain campus to another campus for a given period of time.
At times students are writing and students will be waiting for longer period
or end up fighting to get space on the available bus.

Management of transportation do not know how many students are at the
terminal, the expect that one bus will be enough and students results in
exchanging words with the bus drivers.

Assumptions are made based on what is happening on the scene(terminal)
and these days we see a person responsible in monitoring which bus goes
where and if students are are accommodated.

Certain days are bad to a point where, the person wont be able to monitor
the processes.


## Challenges

1.Shortage of buses – Transport management doesn’t provide enough bus to student, we have about 5 campus and each campus has various departments and each department have many students but only 1 bus per hour.

2.Time consuming - When you want to take a bus from Pretoria bus terminal to another campus and you find that the number of the student that are allowed to enter into that bus at that time is exceeded you have to wait for another bus which it’s about an hour.

## Proposed Solution

As Junior Developer,
you are required to come with
an innovative solution to solve
the above solution.


## PROJECT PLAN

1.Extra buses – I propose that TUT must increase the number of buses at least 2 buses per hour to avoid student waiting for the longest of time waiting for the bus, some they miss classes due to the shortage of buses at that time so they have to wait for an hour for another bus to come.

2.Bus should come after 30min

ADVANTAGES

>Less student on bus terminal
>No longer wait for the longest of time

DISADVANTAGES

>Increase Petrol/diesel
