## Current Situation

Covid tried to rescue the pandemic that occurred almost everyday at the
bus terminal of some of the Pretoria Campuses. Usually, there is one bus
from a certain campus to another campus for a given period of time.
At times students are writing and students will be waiting for longer period
or end up fighting to get space on the available bus.

Management of transportation do not know how many students are at the
terminal, the expect that one bus will be enough and students results in
exchanging words with the bus drivers.

Assumptions are made based on what is happening on the scene(terminal)
and these days we see a person responsible in monitoring which bus goes
where and if students are are accommodated.

Certain days are bad to a point where, the person wont be able to monitor
the processes.
